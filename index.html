            <p>After being approached to do a concept album of hip-hop as it would sound in different time periods, Emcee Elemental created the character of Professor Elemental. While the album never came to fruition, the character stuck.[2] Professor Elemental has since been seen performing as a solo act or in theatre acts such as Come into My Parlour. He is also popular at steampunk events and has been a headliner at the Steampunk World's Fair and the Waltz on the Wye.</p>
            <p>The Professor Elemental character first gained notoriety with his music video for "Cup of Brown Joy," (Directed by Moog) which got the attention of Warren Ellis. Since then he has released a new album, continued his work in the community and performed live. He was, until recently, in a feud with fellow "chap-hop" artist Mr. B The Gentleman Rhymer.[3] However, Professor Elemental had a short appearance in Mr. B's music video for the song "Just Like a Chap", of which Professor Elemental said "much as I hate to admit it, I bloody love that video and am jolly glad [Mr. B] let me gate crash."[4] Mr. B reciprocated with a cameo on Elemental's video for his song, "I'm British" (which also featured appearances by members of the Eccentric Club, of which Elemental is a member).[5] The two seem to have finally settled their differences in the track, "The Duel", on Elemental's 2012 album The Father of Invention, where, after a rap battle, both agree that the other is "jolly good" at what they do and go to enjoy a crate of sherry and some opium.</p>
